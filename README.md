# Quoted Coding Challenge

**Assignment** - Create a web app called **Quoted**. The features of **Quoted** include:

- Users can create an account for themselves
- Users can edit their basic information
- Users can upload their profile picture
- Users can upload quotes to the app for everyone to see. Each entry should contain the following entities:
- The quote
- Name of the author
- Profile pic of the author or a placeholder if no profile pic uploaded
- timestamp of when the quote was created
- A homepage where all the quotes ever written on the app are shown in descending order of their timestamp with the most recent one on top
- Users should be logged in to use the features of the app.
- Users can edit and delete the quotes only if they are the author of the same
- **(Optional) Bonus:** Users can like quotes and quotes should display the number of likes received.

Please be sure to use a **mobile-first approach** for this challenge. Make the app desktop-responsive only if time allows, **but it is mandatory for the app to be mobile-responsive**.

This exercise is designed to give you unlimited creative freedom as you develop a solution /
implementation. Feel free to use any packages/tools as you see fit; the goal is a functional mobile-responsive app
with a reasonable amount of CSS stylings and efficient use of Firestore.
